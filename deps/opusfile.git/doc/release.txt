= Release checklist =

Source release:

- Update OP_LT_* API versioning in configure.ac.
- Check for uncommitted changes to master.
- Tag the release commit with 'git tag -s vN.M'.
 - Include release notes in the tag annotation.
- Verify 'make distcheck' produces a tarball with
  the desired name.
- Push tag to public repo.
- Upload source package 'opusfile-${version}.tar.gz'
  to website and verify file permissions.
- Update checksum files on website.
- Update links on <https://www.opus-codec.org/downloads/>.
- Add a copy of the documentation to <https://www.opus-codec.org/docs/>
  and update the links.

Releases are commited to https://svn.xiph.org/releases/opus/
which propagates to downloads.xiph.org, and copied manually
to https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/opus/

Release packages should also be manually attached to the corresponding
tag on the github mirror https://github.com/xiph/opusfile/releases

Win32 binaries:

- Assuming the mingw cross toolchain:
- run `make -C mingw`
  - Downloads versions of libogg, opus, openssl.
  - Compiles them.
  - Compiles static opusfile and examples against the built deps.
- Compile dynamic opusfile with:
  - ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --prefix=/path/to/builddir/mingw \
        PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/builddir/mingw/lib/pkgconfig
  - make && make check && make -C doc/latex
- Add api docs to opus-codec.org.
- mkdir opusfile-${version}-win32
- Copy AUTHORS COPYING README.txt include/opusfile.h to the release dir.
- Merge changes between README.txt and the version in the last
  binary release. E.g. it's good to include versions of the dependencies,
  release notes, etc.
- Convert README.txt to DOS line endings.
- Copy .libs/libopusfile-0.dll to the release dir.
- Copy .libs/libopusfile.a to the release dir.
- Copy .libs/libopusfile.dll.a to the release dir. (May not be needed?)
- Copy ./lib/libopusurl-0.dll, etc. to the release dir.
- Copy ./bin/*.dll to the release dir for dependencies.
- Copy any other dependent dlls, e.g. on Fedora 23 I needed to copy
    /usr/i686-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin/libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll
    /usr/i686-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin/libwinpthread-1.dll
- Copy doc/latex/refman.pdf to opusfile-${version}-win32/opusfile-${version}.pdf
- Copy examples/.libs/*.exe to the release dir.
- Strip *.dll *.a *.exe in the release dir.
- In the release dir, run:
    sha256sum * > SHA256SUMS.txt
    gpg --detach-sign --armor SHA256SUMS.txt
- In the parent directory, create the archive:
    zip -r opusfile-${version}-win32.zip opusfile-${version}-win32/*
- Copy the archive to a clean system and verify the examples work
  to make sure you've included all the necessary libraries.
- Upload the archive zipfile to websites.
- Verify file permissions and that it's available at the expected
  URL.
- Update links on <http://www.opus-codec.org/downloads/>.
- Add doc/latex/refman as docs/opusfile_api-${version}.pdf on opus-codec.org
- Add doc/html as docs/opusfile_api-${version} on opus-codec.org
